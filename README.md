## Code Structure

This repository contains two separate implementations:

1. **Mathematical Demonstration (eigenfaces_math_demo.ipynb)**  
   A from-scratch implementation using a small synthetic dataset to validate
   the mathematical working of PCA, eigenfaces, projection, reconstruction,
   and distance-based recognition.

2. **System-Level Implementation (eigenfaces_orl_system.ipynb)**  
   An extended implementation applied to the AT&T (ORL) face dataset to
   demonstrate full-scale facial recognition performance.

   This implementation is adapted and extended from publicly available
   open-source code, with modifications for analysis, evaluation, and
   visualization as part of this academic project.
